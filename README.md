# telescopes-indigenous-lands
This map is a non-comprehensive map of the telescopes around the world and the Indigenous lands on which they are located.
The data for Indigenous nations and their territories is taken from https://native-land.ca/ and we are very grateful for the hard work that the Native Land Digital team has put in to create their maps and other resources. You can read more about them here: https://native-land.ca/about/our-team/.
The current version of the map is hosted here: https://www.astro.utoronto.ca/~kutra/telescopes_indigenous_lands.html
